This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to analyzing weather forecast data and building a predictive machine learning model. It includes a dataset of temperature forecasts for London and New York City and a Python script designed to evaluate the accuracy of various forecasting services and predict future temperatures.

The dataset is a CSV file containing historical weather forecast data for London and New York City, specifically for the EGLC and KLGA weather station. It is structured to compare forecasts from multiple sources against the actual recorded temperatures.

The Python script is a complete data analysis and machine learning pipeline. It uses libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, and scikit-learn for building and evaluating a predictive model.

Please note: The code is still in progress as I continue to test other machine learning models, and the dataset is still being updated.
